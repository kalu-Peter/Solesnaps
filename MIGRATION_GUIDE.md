🚀 SUPABASE MIGRATION REQUIRED
============================

Your backend server is now configured for Supabase-only mode and is running successfully!

However, you need to run the database migration first before creating users.

📋 STEPS TO COMPLETE SETUP:

1. 🗄️ RUN MIGRATION IN SUPABASE:
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project: grqfmikvwbrvkwzdquul  
   - Navigate to: SQL Editor
   - Copy the contents of: server/migrations/0002_supabase_schema.sql
   - Paste into SQL Editor and click "Run"
   - This will create all tables with UUID primary keys

2. 👥 CREATE USERS:
   - After migration, run: node scripts/setup-users.js
   - This will create 3 test users:
     * admin@solesnaps.com / Admin123! (admin role)
     * customer@solesnaps.com / Customer123! (customer role)  
     * test@solesnaps.com / Test123! (customer role)

3. 🧪 TEST AUTHENTICATION:
   - Server is running at: http://localhost:5000
   - Test endpoints:
     * POST /api/auth/register
     * POST /api/auth/login
     * GET /api/auth/profile

📊 CURRENT STATUS:
✅ Local PostgreSQL disconnected
✅ Supabase client connected
✅ Backend server running (port 5000)
✅ API endpoints ready
⏳ Database migration needed
⏳ Users need to be created

🔧 CONFIGURATION CHANGES MADE:
- Modified server/src/config/database.js (Supabase-only mode)
- Updated server/.env (disabled local PostgreSQL)
- Created user setup script
- Server now uses Supabase API exclusively

⚠️ IMPORTANT: 
The migration will DROP existing tables and create new UUID-based ones.
This is a destructive operation - any existing data will be lost.

Run the migration, then come back and we'll create the users! 🎉
